# Rollaball-Arena
"The Dark Souls of Rollaball"

Mod of Roll-a-ball

Originally I wanted to make a 3D Platformer puzzler where every level taught you a different physics concept. (Points of decelerration, 
the area under a curve being a representation of distance over time, vector independence, distribution of forces, etc.)

Due to time constraints and frustration over implementing the first game mechanic outside of movement, I decided to create a 2-player 
arena style collectathon race. 

The objective of the game is to be the first one to score 10 by collecting pick ups. 
I didn't want to abandon the idea of getting the player to care about kinematics, so the scoring proportional to the player's speed
upon collecting a pick up. An example is if the player is going at a speed above 15 then the player scores +3 up collecting
a pickup. If they are meek, and play it to safe moving below a velocity of 6, then they only score +1. +2 is going the average speed
