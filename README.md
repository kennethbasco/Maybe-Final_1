# Rollaball-Arena
"The Dark Souls of Rollaball"

Mod of Roll-a-ball

Originally I wanted to make a 3D Platformer puzzler where every level taught you a different physics concept. (Points of decelerration, 
the area under a curve being a representation of distance over time, vector independence, distribution of forces, etc.)

Due to time constraints and frustration over implementing the first game mechanic outside of movement, I decided to create a 2-player 
arena style collectathon race. 

The objective of the game is to be the first one to score 10 by collecting pick ups. 
I didn't want to abandon the idea of getting the player to care about kinematics, so the scoring proportional to the player's speed
upon collecting a pick up. An example is if the player is going at a speed above 15 then the player scores +3 up collecting
a pickup. If they are meek, and play it to safe moving below a velocity of 6, then they only score +1. +2 is going the average speed


In this game, you also have the ability to create platforms. However, much like the scoring system, an amount of momentum will be applied in your opposite direction depending on the magnitude you're going. If you go too fast, you will be sent flying in the opposite direction. If you pace yourself and create one or two platform at a time, you will only be slowed down. Sometimes this can be used to cushion your magnitude, other times it will work against you.

Player 1 controls: wasd for movement; c for jump; v for making a platform

Player 2 controls: ijkl for movement; . for jump; / for making a platform


When designing the game I was driven by madness trying to balance numbers organically while also crippling my hands over the clunky controls. The colors are so gaudy because I selected them out of frustration. These mix of emotions sent me back to using the computer for the first time and this is when I realized this is where my love for gaudy things came from. The level started to look like it was from a game preinstalled on a Windows XP computer at a local library. Because of this, I felt it was absolutely necessary to have David Byrne's 'like humans do'play in the background of the game; an appropriate homage to the windows xp operating system the song was preinstalled from. I even added some of the winxp sound fx when players jump or make platforms.
